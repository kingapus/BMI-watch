# BMI-watch
First attempt at a BMI calculator with integrated blood pressure monitor and a tailored counseling audiobook.
This app will ask for inputs on personal identifiers.
Other inputs will be weight and height (in standard or imperial units).
Additionally, user can input blood pressure.
Calculating BMI from weight and height, user is classified as underweight, normal, overweight or obese.
BMI class in addition to blood pressure directs the app to read out some health advise on keeping healthy.


#TO DO: later build a GUI version.
